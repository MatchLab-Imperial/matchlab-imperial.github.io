hero_title: "Learning to match, reconstruct, and understand the 3D world"
intro: "Matchlab is a research group focused on computer vision and machine learning, with the goal to develop algorithms to match, reconstruct, and understand the visual world. We tackle challenges in monocular/stereo depth estimation, novel view synthesis, and open-world 3D perception. We are a part of the <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/intelligent-systems-and-networks/\">Intelligent Systems and Networks Group</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/\">Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> of Imperial College London."
